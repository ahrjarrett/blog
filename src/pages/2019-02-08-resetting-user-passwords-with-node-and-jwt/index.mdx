## JS Everywhere

We were using JWT for encoding sensitive data passed between the client and server, so I decided to stick with that because typing `npm i` sounded hard.

Check out the project’s <a href="https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/LabsPT1_Backwoods" target="_blank">source code on GitHub</a>, or watch the 30 second demo:

We’ll be coding this feature entirely in JavaScript. Let’s dive in!

## Dependencies

- **Express & JWT:** I’m assuming you know enough Express to create a simple service that listens on a given route. Working knowledge of JWTs will also help; if you’re fuzzy, check out the <a href="https://jwt.io/" target="_blank">JWT website</a> for a refresher on JWT headers, payloads and signatures.
- **Nodemailer:** Super simple <a href="https://nodemailer.com/about/" target="_blank">npm module for sending email</a>. We’ll create a quick and dirty email template and configure it to send reset emails from our own email address — make sure you use something like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv" target="_blank">dotenv</a> if you plan on pushing to GitHub, otherwise your email password will be made public!

## Theory

This is the part of the blog post I would usually skip personally, but _I recommend you actually read this part_, otherwise you might end up being confused when we get to implementation.

Let’s make sure we’re on the same page about a few things, security-wise:

1. We’re not going to send the user her password via email.
2. Because we care about security, we’re using something like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs" target="_blank">bcryptjs</a> so that _we don’t store the user’s password at all_. At least not in plain text. Instead we hash it, and sending the user a hashed password is worse than doing nothing at all because she will probably assume her password has been compromised.
3. We’re also not going to send the user a temporary password because we can’t assume the user’s inbox is secure. If the user gets distracted and forgets to follow the link we email her, there is a live password just waiting in her inbox. Not to mention a malicious actor or jilted ex could reset the user’s password over and over, keeping her from logging into the wonderful app we made.

Instead, we’re going to **generate a single-use link** that the user can follow to enter a new password. **This link will also expire after a set amount of time**, in this case 60 minutes.

### Creating a Single-Use URL

We need a way to validate our user. To do this, we’re going to **embed a JWT token that identifies her in the URL we generate**. When she clicks this link, our user will be presented a form that allows her to enter a new password.

As a payload, the JWT token needs to carry something that we can use to effectively fingerprint the user. Once she visits the route we send her, our server will pull the token from the route params and use it to identify her.

Before we talk about the JWT payload, let’s make sure we all understand the control flow:

**Order of operations:**

1. User enters her email into a password reset form which sends a POST request to the endpoint `/reset_pw/user/:email`
2. We sign a JWT on the backend using a dynamic payload and secret key
3. An email service mounted at that route in step 1 emails her a URL containing the token
4. The user clicks the link and is taken to a client-side form. Then, our client-side router pulls the token off params as it resolves her request (our team used React Router to do this)
5. User submits the form which makes a POST request to `/new_pw/:userId/:token` with the new password **on the request body** (parameters being easier to intercept)
6. Our then server decodes the token using a secret key unique to the user, hashes the new password, and replaces the old password hash with the new one

### JWT Secret & Payload

So what should our JWT’s payload be?

This confused me until I realized I was asking the wrong question. A better question is: **What should our secret key be?**

The payload itself doesn’t matter as much as the fact that it matches.

Let’s say you and I are both spies, meeting for the first time. We don’t know if we can trust each other yet. Of course, no good spy actually trusts another spy, not truly; but we agree that some tests are better than others, and begin talking about ways to verify that the other is in face who she claims to be.

Before long we reach an impasse. Given our line of work, we cannot use information as a way to authenticate each other, because we might be giving something away by the very act of trying to verify it. We could try blurting out the name of the target together on three, but that’s the oldest trick in the book and neither one of us is falling for that one again.

Instead, you point out that it doesn’t actually matter _what_ we know, but that we can demonstrate the ability to know it. We don’t need to know what’s behind door number 1, so long as we both have a key that can open it.

> To make a one-time URL, we use the user’s old hashed password as the JWT secret key. When the user updates her password, we will replace the old hash with the new one, and no one can access the secret key anymore.

In order to make sure this link can’t be used and reused over and over again, the link should “expire” — meaning that our token (and by extension, the URL) should only work once.

After researching how to do this, I came across a very clever solution:

To make a one-time URL, we use the user’s old hashed password as the JWT secret key. When the user updates her password, we will replace the old hash with the new one, and no one can access the secret key anymore.

This helps to ensure that if the user’s password was the target of a previous attack (on an unrelated website), then the user’s created date will make the secret key unique from the potentially leaked password.

Get it?

It took me a bit to wrap my head around.

To make this even more secure, we can concatenate the old password hash with the user’s `createdAt` value, so that if someone intercepts the user token from the network, he would still need a user’s timestamp to crack the secret key.

With the combination of the user’s password hash and `createdAt` date the JWT becomes a one-time-use token, because once the user has changed her password, _successive calls to that route will generate a new password hash, invalidating the secret key which references the defunct password_.

**So what should the payload be?**

As long as it’s something unique to the user that our server can compare, that’s up to you. In our case, we used the `userId`, and the server just made sure that the decoded payload matches our user’s ID in the database.

## Implementation

Now that all the theory is behind us, let’s look at one possible implementation:

### Server

#### File: `email.controller.js`:

<a href="https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/LabsPT1_Backwoods/blob/master/server/src/api/resources/email/email.controller.js" target="_blank">See it on GitHub</a>

**Imports:**

```javascript
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken"
import bcrypt from "bcryptjs"
import { User } from "../user/user.model"
import {
  transporter,
  getPasswordResetURL,
  resetPasswordTemplate
} from "../../modules/email"
```

Here we pull in our User model and email module, which are implementation details. Again, see the <a href="https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/LabsPT1_Backwoods" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> if you want to dig into all the specifics.

**Make token from hash helper function:**

```javascript
// `secret` is passwordHash concatenated with user's
// createdAt value, so if someone malicious gets the
// token they still need a timestamp to hack it:
export const usePasswordHashToMakeToken = ({
  password: passwordHash,
  _id: userId,
  createdAt
}) => {
  // highlight-start
  const secret = passwordHash + "-" + createdAt
  const token = jwt.sign({ userId }, secret, {
    expiresIn: 3600 // 1 hour
  })
  // highlight-end
  return token
}
```

Here we pass the old password hash, user ID and created at values into a function that signs a token with `userId` as the payload and `${passwordHash}-${createdAt}` as a secret.

**Sending the email:**

```javascript
//// Sends an email IRL! ////
export const sendPasswordResetEmail = async (req, res) => {
  const { email } = req.params
  let user
  try {
    user = await User.findOne({ email }).exec()
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(404).json("No user with that email")
  }
  const token = usePasswordHashToMakeToken(user)
  const url = getPasswordResetURL(user, token)
  const emailTemplate = resetPasswordTemplate(user, url)

  const sendEmail = () => {
    transporter.sendMail(emailTemplate, (err, info) => {
      if (err) {
        res.status(500).json("Error sending email")
      }
      console.log(`** Email sent **`, info.response)
    })
  }
  sendEmail()
}
```

This function find’s our user by email, makes a token, builds up a URL, then calls our email module and fires off an email IRL.

**Updating the user’s password:**

```javascript
export const receiveNewPassword = (req, res) => {
  const { userId, token } = req.params
  const { password } = req.body

  // highlight-start
  User.findOne({ _id: userId })
    .then(user => {
      const secret = user.password + "-" + user.createdAt
      const payload = jwt.decode(token, secret)
      if (payload.userId === user.id) {
        bcrypt.genSalt(10, function(err, salt) {
          // Call error-handling middleware:
          if (err) return
          bcrypt.hash(password, salt, function(err, hash) {
            // Call error-handling middleware:
            if (err) return
            User.findOneAndUpdate({ _id: userId }, { password: hash })
              .then(() => res.status(202).json("Password changed accepted"))
              .catch(err => res.status(500).json(err))
          })
        })
      }
    })
    // highlight-end

    .catch(() => {
      res.status(404).json("Invalid user")
    })
}
```

This nasty function is the meat of the program. Originally we wrote this using the async/await protocol like `sendPasswordResetEmail` above, but bcrypt didn’t seem to like async/await.

What’s interesting is that, despite the callback hell, this function never created any bugs and never needed to be rewritten.

#### File: `email.restRouter.js`

<a href="https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/LabsPT1_Backwoods/blob/master/server/src/api/resources/email/email.restRouter.js" target="_blank">See it on GitHub</a>

Then we mount the service in `email.restRouter.js` (rest router as opposed to GraphQL router, which this blog is written in):

```javascript
import express from "express"
import * as emailController from "./email.controller"

export const emailRouter = express.Router()

emailRouter.route("/user/:email").post(emailController.sendPasswordResetEmail)

emailRouter
  .route("/receive_new_password/:userId/:token")
  .post(emailController.receiveNewPassword)
```

### What about the client?

Initially we were going to do everything on the server, but then we decided that React Router and Axios were enough to pass params to and from the Express server.

There are really only 2 client-side files of interest.

#### File: `RecoverPassword.js`

<a href="https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/LabsPT1_Backwoods/blob/master/client/src/components/forms/RecoverPassword.js" target="_blank">See it on GitHub</a>

This component doesn’t need to accept any props because the user hasn’t taken any action yet besides navigate to the component. Notice how the component renders based on local state, and how the Axios call to our server endpoint is made:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react"
import { Link } from "react-router-dom"
import styled from "styled-components"

import { Button, GhostInput } from "./styledComponents"
import RecoverPasswordStyles from "./RecoverPassword.styles"

import axios from "axios"
import SERVER_URI = "localhost:3000"

class RecoverPassword extends Component {
  state = {
    email: "",
    submitted: false
  }

  handleChange = e => {
    this.setState({ email: e.target.value })
  }

  sendPasswordResetEmail = e => {
    e.preventDefault()
    const { email } = this.state
    axios.post(`${SERVER_URI}/reset_password/user/${email}`)
    this.setState({ email: "", submitted: true })
  }

  render() {
    const { email, submitted } = this.state

    return (
      <RecoverPasswordStyles>
        <h3>Reset your password</h3>
        {submitted ? (
          <div className="reset-password-form-sent-wrapper">
            <p>
              If that account is in our system, we emailed you a link to reset
              your password.
            </p>
            <Link to="/login" className="ghost-btn">
              Return to sign in
            </Link>
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="reset-password-form-wrapper">
            <p>
              It happens to the best of us. Enter your email and we'll send you
              reset instructions.
            </p>
            <form onSubmit={this.sendPasswordResetEmail}>
              <GhostInput
                onChange={this.handleChange}
                value={email}
                placeholder="Email address"
              />
              <Button className="btn-primary password-reset-btn">
                Send password reset email
              </Button>
            </form>
            <Link to="/login">I remember my password</Link>
          </div>
        )}
      </RecoverPasswordStyles>
    )
  }
}

export default RecoverPassword
```

That’s it, it’s actually pretty simple. We can use React Router to mount it wherever we want. We went with `/password/recover` because we had other password functionality that we bundled under the `/password` namespace.

#### File: `UpdatePassword.js`

<a href="https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/LabsPT1_Backwoods/blob/master/client/src/components/forms/UpdatePassword.js" target="_blank">See it on GitHub</a>

Here’s how we might use the `UpdatePassword` component using React Router:

```jsx
<Route
  path="/update-password"
  render={({ match }) => (
    <UpdatePassword userId={match.params.userId} token={match.params.token} />
  )}
/>
```

And here’s what the component itself looks like:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react"
import axios from "axios"
import { Link } from "react-router-dom"
import PropTypes from "prop-types"

import { Button, GhostInput } from "./customStyledComponents"
import { RecoverPasswordStyles as UpdatePasswordStyles } from "./RecoverPassword"

const SERVER_URI = "localhost:3000"

class UpdatePassword extends Component {
  state = {
    password: "",
    confirmPassword: "",
    submitted: false
  }

  handleChange = key => e => {
    this.setState({ [key]: e.target.value })
  }

  updatePassword = e => {
    e.preventDefault()
    const { userId, token } = this.props
    const { password } = this.state

    axios
      .post(
        `${SERVER_URI}/reset_password/receive_new_password/${userId}/${token}`,
        { password }
      )
      .then(res => console.log("RESPONSE FROM SERVER TO CLIENT:", res))
      .catch(err => console.log("SERVER ERROR TO CLIENT:", err))
    this.setState({ submitted: !this.state.submitted })
  }

  render() {
    const { submitted } = this.state

    return (
      <UpdatePasswordStyles>
        <h3 style={{ paddingBottom: "1.25rem" }}>Update your password</h3>
        {submitted ? (
          <div className="reset-password-form-sent-wrapper">
            <p>Your password has been saved.</p>
            <Link to="/login" className="ghost-btn">
              Sign back in
            </Link>
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="reset-password-form-wrapper">
            <form
              onSubmit={this.updatePassword}
              style={{ paddingBottom: "1.5rem" }}
            >
              <GhostInput
                onChange={this.handleChange("password")}
                value={this.state.password}
                placeholder="New password"
                type="password"
              />
              <GhostInput
                onChange={this.handleChange("confirmPassword")}
                value={this.state.confirmPassword}
                placeholder="Confirm password"
                type="password"
              />

              <Button className="btn-primary password-reset-btn">
                Update password
              </Button>
            </form>
          </div>
        )}
      </UpdatePasswordStyles>
    )
  }
}

UpdatePassword.propTypes = {
  token: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  userId: PropTypes.string.isRequired
}

export default UpdatePassword
```

That’s a wrap! Of course there’s more to the implementation, but for sake of brevity I will simply link to the other relevant files here:
