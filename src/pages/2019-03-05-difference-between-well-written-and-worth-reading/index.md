# The Difference Between Well-Written & Worth-Reading

I'll admit, I got carried away. Walking away from `quixote.dev` felt like a betrayal of a younger, more cultured me, but I didn’t bite. Instead I bought `jeeves.dev` because I wanted to put [ask@jeeves.dev](mailto:ask@jeeves.dev) on resumes and because I who knows, maybe that's what I go by from now on.

Out of respect for the Knight of the Sorrowful Face, I reread the introduction, in which Don Quixote is driven to mad by overexposure to the high language of knight errantry.

> “Finally, from so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain dried up and he went completely out of his mind.”

This line was always one of my favorites. In my experience the test of a good book is not just whether I liked it, but whether it gives me something new when I pick it back up.

I remember where I was when I read that line. Books do that to me like movies never have.

Today I was reminded me of Tommy, an old friend. Along with being a generally quixotic dude, he also helped design a video arcade cabinet called [LAZA KNITEZ](http://www.lazaknitez.com/) — starring rogues the likes of Lord Lanzalot the Lewd, Duke Dwayne the Dastardly, and Earl Earl the Early Earl — Tommy was the loud, fun, cocky SOB that you’d picture coming up out of the Bayou, but unexpectedly and without a shade of irony in his voice he would drop a line from King Lear, like he’d been a fucking general or alive in the 70s or something. We all fell in love with him immediately, of course.

> Chivalry isn’t dead — it’s just respawning
> — Duke Dwayne the Dastardly

All that to say, I picked up reading again, bought a couple literary .dev domains, and while part of me was overjoyed when I saw my old friends again – Fyodor Karamazov the buffoon, El Caballero de la Triste Figura, Ishmael and all the ones I’ve forgotten since I since my books — what I mostly felt was this lowkey sense of my burned out self.

So I pulled out the bankers box whose stationary perch atop my desk was once a poison to me, the slow sick poisoning of my own literary inertia. I avoided that box like I would a conversation with a stranger. Or worse, an obsequious acquaintance that you dislike but feel bad about disliking, he’s nice and besides personality is just a construct, an interface we create between ourselves and our environment, right? so you try to smile, say his name and look him in the eye, and so forth, but suddenly you feel every bit as obsequious and subject to your environment as he is. Next time I’ll be colder. More honest. Honesty, I owe him that. Proximity alone is not sufficient cause for friendship.

Anyway I opened the box and it’s such a drag. Everything hurts, especially the passages I remembered and was excited to read — my anticipation was salt in the would. I felt foolish.

I also realized something about younger, “writerly” self. All of my prose aspired to be _well-written_; even had I achieved that, I never asked if what I was writing was **worth reading**. In fact, I took it for granted.

What was the point of all of this? _Why_ had I written so much, so often?

If I’m being honest with myself, it was all about my ego.

What astounds me is my own capacity for self-deception. I used to fantacising about younger writers one day looking up to me, poring over my words the way I did my heroes _while_ talking to dates in coffeeshops about how I didn’t really like to talk about it becaue it seemed pretentious.

It _was_ pretentious.

To the extent that I was posturing myself, it was pretentious. My love for reading, and fiction in particular, has been a defining theme in my life. Books have ruined me and books have made me. But when I discovered in college that loving books was an attractive quality, I sold out and convinced myself I hadn’t by doubling down, reading more pages, carrying a pen with me at all times, in case a moment of inspiration struck (or a pretty girl was nearby)?

I supposed it’s easy to second guess myself. Maybe my intentions were pure, or at least I thought they were.

If you’re like me, you can be too hard on yourself. Maybe this is that. Or maybe that’s an excuse and learning how to tell the truth again is painful. Maybe the next lesson will be knowing the difference between a time to talk publicly and a time to shut the hell up.

But this one seems like a lesson worth learning, if only to say make up for all the times I sung these words like I knew what they meant:

> I need three years to clear these thoughts, hey
> I like to say I knew one true thing
> It feels like years and all I've done is fought
> And not turned up anything
> _Rain King_, Sonic Youth

And so, for all the lip service I just paid to telling the truth, I would be remiss if I didn’t say that some small part of me isn’t secretly happy with how this part has aged.

And if I could do it over again, I would tell myself to find a mentor. A mentor who, at times, treats me like a peer, so that our rapport has some basis; a sharp word from a drill instructor stings in a very different way than the rebuke of a peer. Find someone who cares enough about the craft that they find carelessness, offensive — even hurtful.

Then again, it’s easy to become too familiar with a mentor, to the point that you both become complacent friends. It is always much more difficult to reestablish boundaries than to maintain them.

Some would argue that this is the natural way of things; formal roles always dissolve eventually, relationships are dynamic and like all things, tend toward entropy. I agree.

For me — and maybe just me, although I suspect not — this is all the more reason to find and fight to keep a mentor. Someone you care about, such that you become a member of their support system, but not your emergency contact.

> Just a half-eaten sandwich and some soggy napkins.

Anyway, that’s enough from me. I am not going to revise this much; I doubt revision would really be the difference between well-written and worth-reading for this post.

So yes, I’m disappointed. Disappointed that I didn’t trip over my own genius. Everyone wants to discover the unwitting brilliance of her former self in a banker box, or a forgotten Dropbox account somewhere.

For today, I find myself underwhelmed once again by the sheer magnitide of my effort — years, pages, etc. — when compared to the few examples I can produce that are **eloquent, but also useful**.

> And as she slid deeper into her bench, her final thoughts before drifting off were questions she didn't try to answer: where the words had come from and why they’d chosen her, where the tycoon vacationed, if cigars tasted like they smelled and whether God was in it, whether she owed him for the words, whether she might think to write them down so she doesn’t forget the Campbell Soup Company’s new slogan between now and her meeting with Mr. Kirkland at eight.
> Four words that came from nowhere. She dreamed of a stained glass window and rain that fell in angles.
>
> From _Soup Is Good Food_, 2012

Still pretty cringy, especially that meter at the end — I think I was reading Bolaño at the time. Still, there’s enough going on that I’d like to see it through.

Today I bought a bunch of Google dev domains.

Tomorrow I will stay home and play in the AWS console all day until I finally understand how DNS resolves a request.

Or until think of something funny to do with these [jeeves.dev]().

My name’s Andrew, I’d say you should hire me but if you’re really looking for an engineer I probably lost you at Duke Dwayne the Dastardly.

In the off chance that you have something constructive or humorous to say, feel free to ask@jeeves.dev — only give it a week or two, I haven’t gotten around to configuring the name servers yet.

Thanks for reading!
