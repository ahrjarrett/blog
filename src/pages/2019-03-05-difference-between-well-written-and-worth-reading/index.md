# The Difference Between Well-Written & Worth-Reading

I'll admit, I got carried away. Walking away from `quixote.dev` felt like a betrayal of a younger, more cultured me, but I did not bite. Instead I bought `jeeves.dev` because I wanted to put [ask@jeeves.dev](mailto:ask@jeeves.dev) as my email on resumes and because I don't know, maybe that's what I'll go by from now on.

Out of respect for the Knight of the Sorrowful Face, I reread the introduction, where Don Quixote is driven to madness by too much exposure to pulp about knights errant and the fanciful language of chivarly.

> “Finally, from so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain dried up and he went completely out of his mind.”

This line was always one of my favorites. In my experience the test of a good book is not just whether I liked it, but whether it gives me something new when I eventually pick it up again.

I remember where I was when I read that line, and how I felt.

For some reason it reminded me of my friend Tommy, who even before he helped design and launch a video arcade cabinet called [LAZA KNITEZ](http://www.lazaknitez.com/) — starring rogues the likes of Lord Lanzalot the Lewd, Duke Dwayne the Dastardly, and Earl Earl the Early Earl — Tommy was the loud, fun, cocky SOB that you’d picture coming up out of the Bayou, but unexpectedly and without a shade of irony in his voice he would drop a line from King Lear, like he’d been a fucking general or alive in the 70s or something. We all fell in love with him immediately, of course.

All that to say, I picked up reading again, bought a couple literary .dev domains, and while part of me was overjoyed when I saw my old friends again – Fyodor Karamazov the buffoon, El Caballero de la Triste Figura, Ishmael and all the ones I’ve forgotten since I since my books — what I mostly felt was this lowkey sense of my burned out self.

So I pulled out the bankers box whose ever so stationary perch atop my desk used to represent the slow poisoning of my literary inertia. I used to avoid that box like a conversation with a stranger. Or worse, an obsequious acquaintance that you dislike but feel bad about disliking, he’s nice and besides our personality is not a choice as much as a product of the environment our genetic cocktail wound up inhabiting, right? so you make an effort to smile and say their name, look them in the eye and so forth, but when you feel every bit as obsequious and a product of your environment as he is, and next time I owe it to myself to be colder, more honest with him, and before you know it you’re halfway to the library and all you’ve done is think about him and built up a weird aggression about his friendliness.

I opened the box and of course, everything is shit. Even this paragraph that I’m going to put here is pretty cringe-worthy, but screw it nobody reads this and plus besides, I’m secretly kinda happy with how it aged and what it could be if I found a good mentor and started again.
