# The Difference Between Well-Written & Worth-Reading

I'll admit, I got carried away. Walking away from `quixote.dev` felt like a betrayal of a younger, more cultured me, but I did not bite. Instead I bought `jeeves.dev` because I wanted to put [ask@jeeves.dev](mailto:ask@jeeves.dev) as my email on resumes and because I don't know, maybe that's what I'll go by from now on.

Out of respect for the Knight of the Sorrowful Face, I reread the introduction, where Don Quixote is driven to madness by too much exposure to pulp about knights errant and the fanciful language of chivarly.

> “Finally, from so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain dried up and he went completely out of his mind.”

This line was always one of my favorites. In my experience the test of a good book is not just whether I liked it, but whether it gives me something new when I eventually pick it up again.

I remember where I was when I read that line, and how I felt.

For some reason it reminded me of my friend Tommy, who even before he helped design and launch a video arcade cabinet called [LAZA KNITEZ](http://www.lazaknitez.com/) — starring rogues the likes of Lord Lanzalot the Lewd, Duke Dwayne the Dastardly, and Earl Earl the Early Earl — Tommy was the loud, fun, cocky SOB that you’d picture coming up out of the Bayou, but unexpectedly and without a shade of irony in his voice he would drop a line from King Lear, like he’d been a fucking general or alive in the 70s or something. We all fell in love with him immediately, of course.

> Chivalry isn’t dead — it’s just respawning
> — Duke Dwayne the Dastardly

All that to say, I picked up reading again, bought a couple literary .dev domains, and while part of me was overjoyed when I saw my old friends again – Fyodor Karamazov the buffoon, El Caballero de la Triste Figura, Ishmael and all the ones I’ve forgotten since I since my books — what I mostly felt was this lowkey sense of my burned out self.

So I pulled out the bankers box whose ever so stationary perch atop my desk used to represent the slow poisoning of my literary inertia. I used to avoid that box like a conversation with a stranger. Or worse, an obsequious acquaintance that you dislike but feel bad about disliking, he’s nice and besides our personality is not a choice as much as a product of the environment our genetic cocktail wound up inhabiting, right? so you make an effort to smile and say their name, look them in the eye and so forth, but when you feel every bit as obsequious and a product of your environment as he is, and next time I owe it to myself to be colder, more honest with him, and before you know it you’re halfway to the library and all you’ve done is think about him and built up a weird aggression about his friendliness.

I opened the box and of course, everything is shit. Even this paragraph that I’m going to put here is pretty cringe-worthy, but screw it nobody reads this and plus besides, I’m secretly kinda happy with how it aged and what it could be if I found a good mentor and started again.

The feeling of hunger after you’ve forgotten to eat two-three meals and there’s a bag in the crisper and — no.

Just a half-eaten sandwich and some soggy napkins. Will be the name of the autobiography I’d probably have the hubris to some day write.

Who knows. What if this tone and general mood ends up being just my pace and I start thinking aloud in my head to myself, as if I’m on stage but constantly pulling myself over for an aside, less to say anything but more to give myself a change to look at myself in the mirror, wink, and nod approvingly, as if to say: “You, you should write more.”

The only balm to the guilt I would otherwise feel about writing something in a single draft that is neither well written, nor worth reading, is the fact that I created a `published` field on my posts model that allows me to hide my words and procrastinate revision until 6 years from now I find them piled up in a forgotten Dropbox account like a treasure somewhere, and as I pull out pieces and papers I hold my breath because of course, everyone wants to discover the unwitting brilliance of her former self in a Dropbox account somewhere, only to find myself underwhelmed once again by the magnitude of effort, measured in sheer volume of pages or even years, by the enormous amount of time it takes me to find one good, simple sentence.

Below is an excerpt from a chapter I wrote in 2012 and revised, half-heartedly, just now. But before that, an image that I think captures everything I’m about to try to say but better, in a language I can’t read, and without speaking a word.

![The Writing on the Wall: Numerology in the Streets of Bangkok, Thailand](/images/2019-03-05-numerology-in-bangkok.jpg)

> Image: BANGKOK - MAY 27: View of numerology written on a wall in the city centre on May 27, 2013 in Bangkok, Thailand. It is commonplace to see numerology written in public areas in the Thai capital.

From `Soup Is Good Food`, 2012:

> And as she slid deeper into her bench, her final thoughts before drifting off were questions she didn't try to answer: where the words had come from and why they’d chosen her, where the tycoon vacationed, if cigars tasted like they smelled and whether God was in it, whether she owed him for the words, whether she might think to write them down so she doesn’t forget the Campbell Soup Company’s new slogan between now and her meeting with Mr. Kirkland at eight.
> Four words that came from nowhere. She dreamed of a stained glass window and rain that fell in angles.

Still pretty cringy, especially the meter at the end — probably reading Bolaño at the time — but maybe if I loosen up a bit and revise more often, maybe someday I’ll write a thing and it will almost get enough momentum to justify a second printing, and then across the pond someone will read it and think, yeah.

Today I bought:

- [vampire.dev]()
- [dracula.dev]()
- [jeeves.dev]()
- a friend a dev domain that reminded me of him

Today I thought about buying:

- [ooo.dev]()
- [blob.dev]()
- [mobydick.dev]()
- [zombie.dev]() for my dad, who let zombiebegone.com expire
- Essential oils and candles
- A record player

Today I should have bought:

- Socks
- Oatmeal and omega-3s

Tomorrow I will stay home and play in the AWS console all day until I finally understand how DNS resolves a request. Or until think of something humorous to do with these domains.

I’m Andrew, I’d say you should hire me but if you’re really looking for engineers, you stopped a long time ago.

In the off chance that you have something constructive or hilarious to say, you can reach me at ask@jeeves.dev — only give it a week from today before you send anything, I haven’t gotten around to configuring my name servers yet.
