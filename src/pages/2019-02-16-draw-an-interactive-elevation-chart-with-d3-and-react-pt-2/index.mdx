## Drawing the Chart

This is a series on using D3, React and the Google Maps API to create data visualizations. We’ll be building an interactive, dynamic area chart that plots distance on the x-axis and elevation on the y-axis.

#### [Catch up on part 1 here!](/posts/2019-02-11-draw-an-interactive-elevation-chart-with-d3-and-react)

First let’s remind ourselves what we’re building:

<iframe
  className="youtube-video"
  width="720"
  height="480"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HXlmXwyuKk"
  frameBorder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
/>

We’ve got 5 things to do, plus 1 bonus step to spruce up your chart’s appearance with gridlines that span across the x- and y-scales at each tick on the chart.

## 5 Steps + 1 Bonus

1. Declare our constants, helper functions, and configure D3 so it’s ready for action.
1. Map out our "ElevationGraph" component, including:

   <ul style={{ marginLeft: "3rem" }}>
     <li>– what lives on state & what comes on props?</li>
     <li>– decide which lifecycle methods we’ll need</li>
     <li>– name and pseudocode our custom methods</li>
   </ul>

1. Draw the chart using D3’s API! This is the fun part, and the meat and potatoes of our task today
1. Render that bad boy! We’ll talk styles here too, especially regarding svg styling (wtf is viewPort vs. viewBox, etc.)
1. Write a callback function that draws a DOM element on the map depending on where the user is hovering
1. [Bonus] Make it pretty

### 1. Declarations & Config

#### Helper Functions

First we need some helper functions. This first batch is pure JavaScript, and do not require the D3 library yet (although `fromLatLngToPoint` does expect a Google Map instance as a parameter):

```javascript
export const numOfSamples = 100
export const metersToMiles = m => m * 0.000621371
export const metersToFeet = m => m * 3.28084

export const arraysEqual = (arr1, arr2) => {
  if (arr1.length !== arr2.length) return false
  for (let i = arr1.length; i--; ) {
    if (arr1[i] !== arr2[i]) return false
  }
  return true
}

export const fromLatLngToPoint = (latLng, map) => {
  const topRight = map
    .getProjection()
    .fromLatLngToPoint(map.getBounds().getNorthEast())
  const bottomLeft = map
    .getProjection()
    .fromLatLngToPoint(map.getBounds().getSouthWest())
  const scale = Math.pow(2, map.getZoom())
  const worldPoint = map.getProjection().fromLatLngToPoint(latLng)
  const point = new window.google.maps.Point(
    (worldPoint.x - bottomLeft.x) * scale,
    (worldPoint.y - topRight.y) * scale
  )
  return point
}
```

We export these because ideally we’re putting them in a separate `utils.js` file, to be imported as needed in our `ElevationGraph` component.

The first, `numOfSamples`, is a constant; we will be using the number of samples in a few places, so it’s easier to change later because we declare it in a single place. We choose 100 samples along our pathline because it makes the math easy. For example, if our area chart is 600 pixels wide, then we need to divide it up into 6px sections and create a hover event over each to dynamically render a point or “blip” on the map to show the user exactly where on the path she would encounter the elevation and grade our Infobox shows her.

The next two are functions we will use to do unit conversion. The Google Maps Elevation and Distance APIs return us meters, but since we do things backwards in the States, we need to convert those to miles and feet so our user doesn’t have to do conversions herself.

`arraysEqual` returns true if 2 arrays contain the same elements and false if they don’t.

We will come back to `fromLatLngToPoint` toward the end of the article — in a nutshell, it takes a `LatLng` object and a Google Map instance and does a lookup to see where a particular coordinate exists on the user’s screen, so we know where to draw the blip.

#### D3 Config

It’s finally time to start working with D3! First let’s make sure we installed and imported it correctly:

```jsx
import * as d3 from "d3"

const D3Version = () => (
  <p id="d3-version">
    D3 Version: <strong>{d3.version}</strong>
  </p>
)

<D3Version />
```

That renders:

<br />
<D3Version />

Cool! Let’s start configuring:

```javascript
// 1. DECLARATIONS / CONFIG
const margin = { top: 0, right: 0, bottom: 15, left: 50 }
const width = 750 - margin.left - margin.right
const height = 155 - margin.top - margin.bottom
const xAxisTicks = 8
const yAxisTicks = 6
```

This is the conventional way of creating margins around your chart in D3.

Next week need to create our xScale and yScale. We will use a linear scale for both.

> For continuous quantitative data, you typically want a linear scale.
>
> [- D3 Docs](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#linear-scales)

We need to give our linear scale a domain and a range:

```javascript
const xScale = d3
  .scaleLinear()
  .domain(d3.extent(data, d => d.x))
  .range([0, width])

const yScale = d3
  .scaleLinear()
  .domain([d3.min(data, co => co.y), d3.max(data, co => co.y)])
  .range([height, 0])
```

`d3.scaleLinear` is a function that creates a scale based on the domain and range you pass it.

1. `domain` takes an array of 2 values that represent the maximum and minimum values in our data set.

To avoid having to hardcode this, we can use `d3.min` and `d3.max`, passing in our entire data set and a function that tells D3 how to resolve our data objects to the values we care about.

In this case, because the x-axis only cares about `data.x` and our y-axis only cares about `data.y`, mapping out the domain is really simple:

```javascript
d3.scaleLinear().domain([d3.min(data, co => co.y), d3.max(data, co => co.y)])
```

2. `range` takes an array of 2 values that represent the boundaries of our svg chart as they will be drawn on the screen.

Cool! Let’s draw the chart. We won’t be plotting the data yet, but it should render at the side we expect based on the data we pass in.

### Drawing the SVG

How do we actually draw the chart?

We're going to use D3 the select a DOM node, append an svg element, give it some attributes, and append elements to it (=path= and =g= elements, specifically).

```javascript
const svg = d3
  .select("#elevationChart")
  .append("svg")
  .attr("width", 750)
  .attr("height", 155)
  .attr("viewBox", "0 0 " + width + " " + 160)
```

D3 is nice to read. Even without knowing the library, we can follow what is going on. D3 selectors and DOM mutations are so much easier to work with than vanilla JavaScript!

_Aside:_ It’s almost _too_ easy with D3! We should be mindful of this, and only be mutating our chart, and delegate any other stateful effects to React to be handled more responsibly.

Let’s call `drawChart` when the component has mounted, and voilà!

<Chart
  targetNode={"#chart1"}
  data={data.fakeData1}
  transform="translate(47.6, 7.5)"
  background="rgb(242, 246, 233)"
  lineColor="51, 51, 51"
>
  <div id="chart1" />
</Chart>

**Look, we did a thing!** We’re like, _artists_ or something.

Here’s what the code looks like right now. This is just everything we’ve done thus far, put together:

```jsx
import React from "react"
import * as d3 from "d3"
import { data } from "./data" // This would be an API call IRL!
const margin = { top: 0, right: 0, bottom: 15, left: 50 }
const width = 700 - margin.left - margin.right
const height = 155 - margin.top - margin.bottom

export default class Chart extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      data: null
    }
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.setState({ data }, () => this.drawChart())
  }

  drawChart = () => {
    const { data } = this.state
    const xScale = d3
      .scaleLinear()
      .domain(d3.extent(data, d => d.x))
      .range([0, width])
    const yScale = d3
      .scaleLinear()
      .domain([d3.min(data, co => co.y), d3.max(data, co => co.y)])
      .range([height, 0])
    const svg = d3
      .select("#elevationChart")
      .append("svg")
      .attr("width", 700)
      .attr("height", 155)
      .attr("viewBox", "0 0 " + width + " " + 160)
      .attr("preserveAspectRatio", "xMinYMid")
      .append("g")
      .attr("transform", `translate(${margin.left}, 2.5)`)

    svg
      .append("g")
      .attr("transform", `translate(0, ${height})`)
      .call(d3.axisBottom(xScale))

    svg.append("g").call(d3.axisLeft(yScale))
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div style={{
        display: "flex",
        justify-content: "center",
        box-shadow: "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 0px 0.625rem 0px"
      }}>
        {this.state.data.length > 0 && <div id="elevationChart" />}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

This is all pretty simple and stateful. We draw a chart by mutating the DOM and pass it our data. But how do we know what our x- and y-domains are without labels?

Before we get into labelling the axes, let’s draw something first!!

What if we gave our chart some data? Let’s pass it 3 points:

```jsx
const data = [
  { x: 5, y: 15 },
  { x: 15, y: 20 },
  { x: 35, y: 5 }
]
<Chart data={data} />
```

Remember, the domains of our `xScale` and `yScale` are created by functions that are calculating the bounds of our chart.

There’s nothing magical about `x` and `y` here, it’s just where I told the D3 functions to look:

```javascript
xScale.domain(d3.extent(data, d => d.x))

yScale.domain([d3.min(data, co => co.y), d3.max(data, co => co.y)])
```

Before our chart will render, we need to tell D3 1.) what kind of visualization we want to draw, and 2.) where

In this case, we decided to draw an area chart — basically a line chart with shading underneath.

Here’s all we have to do!

1. Configure our visualization & pass D3 our scales, so it knows where on the screen to plot each point:
2. Append a path element to our SVG with a `d` attribute containing our data, along with how we want things to render:

```javascript
// 1.)
const area = d3
  .area()
  .x(d => xScale(d.x))
  .y0(yScale(yScale.domain()[0]))
  .y1(d => yScale(d.y))

// 2.)
svg
  .append("path")
  .attr("d", area(data))
  .attr("class", "chartLine")
  .style("stroke", "#787979")
  .style("stroke-opacity", 0.2)
  .style("stroke-width", 1)
  .style("fill", "#787979")
  .style("fill-opacity", 0.2)
```

Input:

```
{ x: 5, y: 15 },
{ x: 15, y: 20 },
{ x: 35, y: 5 }
```

Let’s try it out:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<Chart
  targetNode={"#chart2"}
  data={data.fakeData2}
  transform="translate(47.5, 5)"
  lineColor="29, 29, 29"
  fillColor="102, 173, 204"
  background="rgb(239, 245, 250)"
><div id="chart2" />
</Chart>

_Whoaaa! Who said we wanted labels?_

D3 automatically created ticks for our axes. We’ll adjust these later, but for now we get those for free.

Let’s feed it more data. Can we do something to soften those points a bit?

We can use D3’s `curve` method across our y points and pass it a function name that none of us will ever remember, `curveCatmullRom`:

While we’re there, let’s customize our ticks and add a grid for better visualization:

```javascript
d3.area()
  .x(d => /* ... */)
  .y0(yScale( /* ... */)
  .y1(d => /* ... */)
  .curve(d3.curveCatmullRom.alpha(0.005))

// Let’s write functions that handle spacing our ticks out:
const xAxisTicks = 8
const yAxisTicks = 6
const makeXGridlines = xScale => d3.axisBottom(xScale).ticks(xAxisTicks)
const makeYGridlines = yScale => d3.axisLeft(yScale).ticks(yAxisTicks)

d3.axisBottom(xScale)
  // ...
  .ticks(yAxisTicks)
  .tickSize(0)
  .tickPadding(9)

d3.axisLeft(yScale)
  // ...
  .tickSize(0)
  .tickPadding(8)
  .ticks(yAxisTicks)
```

Cool! Let’s see how it looks.

<Chart
  targetNode={"#chart3"}
  data={data.fakeData3}
  transform="translate(47.5, 5)"
  ticks={true}
  lineColor="87, 64, 67"
  fillColor="146, 105, 111"
  background="rgb(217, 223, 234)"
>
  <div id="chart3" />
</Chart>

Looking pretty good. What about those gridlines?

If we’re feeling clever, we can just make another set of ticks that scale along the same x- and y-scales, only _these will stretch the entire height/width of the svg_.

```javascript
// Make X grid:
svg
  .append("g")
  .attr("class", "chartGrid")
  .attr("transform", `translate(0, ${height})`)
  .call(
    makeXGridlines(xScale)
      // STRETCH IT PARALLEL TO Y:
      .tickSize(-height)
      // NO FORMAT, THESE JUST BE LINES:
      .tickFormat("")
  )

// Make Y grid:
svg
  .append("g")
  .attr("class", "chartGrid")
  .call(
    makeYGridlines(yScale)
      // STRETCH IT PARALLEL TO X:
      .tickSize(-width)
      // NO FORMAT, THESE JUST BE LINES:
      .tickFormat("")
  )
```

You might be noticing a pattern: When we want to add a new feature or visualization,

> _We start by 1.) appending to our SVG element (or “selecting” an existing one), then 2.) configure the appended/selected element by chaining the methods calls we need, 3.) occasionally using `.call` when we need to hook into a different context or functionality._

Let’s see how our gridlines turned out:

<Chart
  targetNode={"#chart4"}
  data={data.fakeData4}
  transform="translate(47.5, 5)"
  ticks={true}
  gridlines={true}
  lineColor="63, 62, 62"
  background="rgb(253, 250, 243)"
  fillColor="15, 103, 36"
>
  <div id="chart4" />
</Chart>

This stuff isn’t super hard. Think of all the stuff we can draw. What if we could consume an API to paint a picture of how little crypto is worth today, compared to its market cap 2 years ago?
