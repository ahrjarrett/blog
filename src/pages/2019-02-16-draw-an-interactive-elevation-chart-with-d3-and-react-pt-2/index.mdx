## Drawing the Chart

This is a series on using D3, React and the Google Maps API to create data visualizations. We’ll be building an interactive, dynamic area chart that plots distance on the x-axis and elevation on the y-axis.

#### [Catch up on part 1 here!](https://blog.thegrepper.com/2019-02-11-draw-an-interactive-elevation-chart-with-d3-and-react)

First let’s remind ourselves what we’re building:

<iframe
  className="youtube-video"
  width="720"
  height="480"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HXlmXwyuKk"
  frameBorder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
/>

We’ve got 5 things to do, plus 1 bonus step to spruce up your chart’s appearance with gridlines that span across the x- and y-scales at each tick on the chart.

## 5 Steps + 1 Bonus

1. Declare our constants, helper functions, and configure D3 so it’s ready for action.
1. Map out our "ElevationGraph" component, including:

   <ul style={{ marginLeft: "3rem" }}>
     <li>– what lives on state & what comes on props?</li>
     <li>– decide which lifecycle methods we’ll need</li>
     <li>– name and pseudocode our custom methods</li>
   </ul>

1. Draw the chart using D3’s API! This is the fun part, and the meat and potatoes of our task today
1. Render that bad boy! We’ll talk styles here too, especially regarding svg styling (wtf is viewPort vs. viewBox, etc.)
1. Write a callback function that draws a DOM element on the map depending on where the user is hovering
1. [Bonus] Make it pretty

### 1. Declarations & Config
