## Drawing the Chart

This is a series on using D3, React and the Google Maps API to create data visualizations. We’ll be building an interactive, dynamic area chart that plots distance on the x-axis and elevation on the y-axis.

#### [Catch up on part 1 here!](/posts/2019-02-11-draw-an-interactive-elevation-chart-with-d3-and-react)

First let’s remind ourselves what we’re building:

<iframe
  className="youtube-video"
  width="720"
  height="480"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HXlmXwyuKk"
  frameBorder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
/>

We’ve got 5 things to do, plus 1 bonus step to spruce up your chart’s appearance with gridlines that span across the x- and y-scales at each tick on the chart.

## 5 Steps + 1 Bonus

1. Declare our constants, helper functions, and configure D3 so it’s ready for action.
1. Map out our "ElevationGraph" component, including:

   <ul style={{ marginLeft: "3rem" }}>
     <li>– what lives on state & what comes on props?</li>
     <li>– decide which lifecycle methods we’ll need</li>
     <li>– name and pseudocode our custom methods</li>
   </ul>

1. Draw the chart using D3’s API! This is the fun part, and the meat and potatoes of our task today
1. Render that bad boy! We’ll talk styles here too, especially regarding svg styling (wtf is viewPort vs. viewBox, etc.)
1. Write a callback function that draws a DOM element on the map depending on where the user is hovering
1. [Bonus] Make it pretty

### 1. Declarations & Config

#### Helper Functions

First we need some helper functions. This first batch is pure JavaScript, and do not require the D3 library yet (although `fromLatLngToPoint` does expect a Google Map instance as a parameter):

```javascript
export const numOfSamples = 100
export const metersToMiles = m => m * 0.000621371
export const metersToFeet = m => m * 3.28084

export const arraysEqual = (arr1, arr2) => {
  if (arr1.length !== arr2.length) return false
  for (let i = arr1.length; i--; ) {
    if (arr1[i] !== arr2[i]) return false
  }
  return true
}

export const fromLatLngToPoint = (latLng, map) => {
  const topRight = map
    .getProjection()
    .fromLatLngToPoint(map.getBounds().getNorthEast())
  const bottomLeft = map
    .getProjection()
    .fromLatLngToPoint(map.getBounds().getSouthWest())
  const scale = Math.pow(2, map.getZoom())
  const worldPoint = map.getProjection().fromLatLngToPoint(latLng)
  const point = new window.google.maps.Point(
    (worldPoint.x - bottomLeft.x) * scale,
    (worldPoint.y - topRight.y) * scale
  )
  return point
}
```

We export these because ideally we’re putting them in a separate `utils.js` file, to be imported as needed in our `ElevationGraph` component.

The first, `numOfSamples`, is a constant; we will be using the number of samples in a few places, so it’s easier to change later because we declare it in a single place. We choose 100 samples along our pathline because it makes the math easy. For example, if our area chart is 600 pixels wide, then we need to divide it up into 6px sections and create a hover event over each to dynamically render a point or “blip” on the map to show the user exactly where on the path she would encounter the elevation and grade our Infobox shows her.

The next two are functions we will use to do unit conversion. The Google Maps Elevation and Distance APIs return us meters, but since we do things backwards in the States, we need to convert those to miles and feet so our user doesn’t have to do conversions herself.

`arraysEqual` returns true if 2 arrays contain the same elements and false if they don’t.

We will come back to `fromLatLngToPoint` toward the end of the article — in a nutshell, it takes a `LatLng` object and a Google Map instance and does a lookup to see where a particular coordinate exists on the user’s screen, so we know where to draw the blip.

#### D3 Config

It’s finally time to start working with D3! First let’s make sure we installed and imported it correctly:

```jsx
import * as d3 from "d3"

const D3Version = () => (
  <p id="d3-version">
    D3 Version: <strong>{d3.version}</strong>
  </p>
)

<D3Version />
```

That renders:

<br />
<D3Version />

Cool! Let’s start configuring:

```javascript
// 1. DECLARATIONS / CONFIG
const margin = { top: 0, right: 0, bottom: 15, left: 50 }
const width = 750 - margin.left - margin.right
const height = 155 - margin.top - margin.bottom
const xAxisTicks = 8
const yAxisTicks = 6
```

This is the conventional way of creating margins around your chart in D3.

Next week need to create our xScale and yScale. We will use a linear scale for both.

> For continuous quantitative data, you typically want a linear scale.
>
> [- D3 Docs](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#linear-scales)

We need to give our linear scale a domain and a range:

```javascript
const xScale = d3
  .scaleLinear()
  .domain(d3.extent(data, d => d.x))
  .range([0, width])

const yScale = d3
  .scaleLinear()
  .domain([d3.min(data, co => co.y), d3.max(data, co => co.y)])
  .range([height, 0])
```

`d3.scaleLinear` is a function that creates a scale based on the domain and range you pass it.

1. `domain` takes an array of 2 values that represent the maximum and minimum values in our data set.

To avoid having to hardcode this, we can use `d3.min` and `d3.max`, passing in our entire data set and a function that tells D3 how to resolve our data objects to the values we care about.

In this case, because the x-axis only cares about `data.x` and our y-axis only cares about `data.y`, mapping out the domain is really simple:

```javascript
d3.scaleLinear().domain([d3.min(data, co => co.y), d3.max(data, co => co.y)])
```

2. `range` takes an array of 2 values that represent the boundaries of our svg chart as they will be drawn on the screen.

Cool! Let’s draw the chart. We won’t be plotting the data yet, but it should render at the side we expect based on the data we pass in.

### Drawing the SVG

How do we actually draw the chart?

We're going to use D3 the select a DOM node, append an svg element, give it some attributes, and append elements to it (=path= and =g= elements, specifically).

```javascript
const svg = d3
  .select("#elevationChart")
  .append("svg")
  .attr("width", 750)
  .attr("height", 155)
  .attr("viewBox", "0 0 " + width + " " + 160)
```

D3 is nice to read. Even without knowing the library, we can follow what is going on. D3 selectors and DOM mutations are so much easier to work with than vanilla JavaScript!

_Aside:_ It’s almost _too_ easy with D3! We should be mindful of this, and only be mutating our chart, and delegate any other stateful effects to React to be handled more responsibly.

Let’s call `drawChart` when the component has mounted, and voilà!

<Chart style={{ paddingTop: "25px", paddingBottom: "10px" }} />

**Look, we did a thing!** We’re like, _artists_ or something.

Here’s what the code looks like right now. This is just everything we’ve done thus far, put together:

```jsx
import React from "react"
import * as d3 from "d3"
import { data } from "./data" // This would be an API call IRL!
const margin = { top: 0, right: 0, bottom: 15, left: 50 }
const width = 700 - margin.left - margin.right
const height = 155 - margin.top - margin.bottom

export default class Chart extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      data: null
    }
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.setState({ data }, () => this.drawChart())
  }

  drawChart = () => {
    const { data } = this.state
    const xScale = d3
      .scaleLinear()
      .domain(d3.extent(data, d => d.x))
      .range([0, width])
    const yScale = d3
      .scaleLinear()
      .domain([d3.min(data, co => co.y), d3.max(data, co => co.y)])
      .range([height, 0])
    const svg = d3
      .select("#elevationChart")
      .append("svg")
      .attr("width", 700)
      .attr("height", 155)
      .attr("viewBox", "0 0 " + width + " " + 160)
      .attr("preserveAspectRatio", "xMinYMid")
      .append("g")
      .attr("transform", `translate(${margin.left}, 2.5)`)

    svg
      .append("g")
      .attr("transform", `translate(0, ${height})`)
      .call(d3.axisBottom(xScale))

    svg.append("g").call(d3.axisLeft(yScale))
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div style={{
        display: "flex",
        justify-content: "center",
        box-shadow: "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 0px 0.625rem 0px"
      }}>
        {this.state.data.length > 0 && <div id="elevationChart" />}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

This is all pretty simple and stateful. We draw a chart by mutating the DOM and pass it our data. But how do we know what our x- and y-domains are without labels?
