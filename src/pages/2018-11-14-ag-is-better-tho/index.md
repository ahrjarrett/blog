I bought thegrepper.com on a whim, but after checking the manual for grep one too many times I started looking for alternatives. [Ag, also known as the Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher).

# ag is better tho

But for real it is. Everything from the order it accepts arguments, to its emphasis on mneumonics, to how it highlights matches in yellow — it’s just better.

It’s also very fast. Much faster than ack, apparently. There’s a chapter about it on [Conquering the Command Line](http://conqueringthecommandline.com/book/ack_ag) that I refer to often.

That concludes my perfunctory first post; I felt that I needed to clear the air.
