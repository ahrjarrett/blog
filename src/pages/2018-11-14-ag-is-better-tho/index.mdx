I bought thegrepper.com on a whim, but after checking the manual for grep one too many times I started looking for alternatives. [Ag, also known as the Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher).

## ag is better tho

But for real. Everything from the order it takes its arguments, to the maintainers’ emphasis on mneumonics, even how it highlights search results in yellow for you — it’s just better.

It’s also very fast. Much faster than ack, apparently. There’s a chapter about it on [Conquering the Command Line](http://conqueringthecommandline.com/book/ack_ag) that unfortunately I don’t look at often enough.

Get on that ag y’all.
