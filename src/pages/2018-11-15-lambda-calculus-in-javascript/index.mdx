After watching Gabriel Lebec’s [excellent talk on the fundamentals of lambda calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VQ382QG-y4), I decided to implement all of the types and combinators that he covered.

[His talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VQ382QG-y4) Lebec recommends a couple books, one of which is [To Mock a Mockingbird](https://www.amazon.com/Mock-Mockingbird-Raymond-Smullyan/dp/0192801422), which I recently picked up.

You can also [view this code in a gist](https://gist.github.com/ahrjarrett/7b67bb161f9a1714c1ddfd7e893c8b73), if you prefer.

```javascript
let { log } = console

I = a => a
M = f => f(f)
K = a => b => a
KI = a => b => b
C = f => a => b => f(b)(a)

I.inspect = () => "I  := 𝝺a.a"
M.inspect = () => "M  := 𝝺f.ff"
K.inspect = () => "K  := 𝝺ab.a"
KI.inspect = () => "KI := 𝝺ab.b"
C.inspect = () => "C  := 𝝺fab.fba"

T = K
F = KI
T.inspect = () => "T / K"
F.inspect = () => "F / KI"
_ = () => "noop"

/**********************************************/
/***   (I) Idiot        ~>  I := 𝝺a.a       ***/

I(I) == I
I(M) == M

/**********************************************/
/***   (M) Mockingbird  ~>  M := 𝝺f.ff      ***/

M(I) == I
// What happens when we self-apply self-application (MM)?
try {
  M(M)
} catch (e) {
  log(e.message)
}
// => Maximum call stack size exceeded

/**********************************************/
/***   (K) Kestral      ~>  K := 𝝺ab.a      ***/

constant_5 = K(5)
constant_5(I) == 5
constant_5(M) == 5
constant_5(1) == 5
constant_5(_) == 5

/**********************************************/
/***   (KI) Kite        ~>  KI := 𝝺ab.b     ***/

KI(1)(0) == K(I)(1)(0)
/* Kite can be derived from Kestral of identity, or KI;
   it can also be derived from CK */
KI == F
KI(M)(KI) == F

/**********************************************/
/***   (C) Cardinal     ~>  C := 𝝺fab.fba   ***/

divide = a => b => a / b
C(divide)(9)(1) == 1 / 9
C(K)(2)(3) == 3

// C takes a function, 2 arguments, and reverses or "flips" them.
// CK takes 2 things, returns the 2nd, which sounds familiar...
// CK and KI are equivalent!
C(K)(I)(M) == KI(I)(M)
C(K)(I)(M) == M
C(K)(I)(M) == I

// CK is built into Haskell as:
// flip const 1 8 == 8

/*** Booleans ***/

not = p => p(F)(T)
// - : not ~> 𝝺p.pFT

not(T) == F
not(F) == T
not(K) == KI
not(KI) == K

// NOT is how we achieve negation.
// Here we're using "booleans" to select 1st value if p is true, otherwise 2nd
// NOT, then, "flips" that formula around. We've already seen flip:

C(T)(1)(2) == 2 //  select 2nd, instead of 1st, on T
C(F)(1)(2) == 1 //  select 1st, instead of 2nd, on F

// The difference is that C generates a new fn, instead of just returning T / F
// So basically we've recreated KI and K, respectively.
// C(T) & KI, C(F) & K have _extensional_, not intensional equality.

and = p => q => p(q)(p)
// - : and ~> 𝝺pq.pqp

// AND is also known as conjunction.
// if p is F, short-circuit & select itself (p)
// if p is T, q determines whether the entire statement is T or F, so defer to q
and(T)(T) == T
and(F)(T) == F
and(T)(F) == F
and(F)(F) == F

or = p => q => p(p)(q)
// - : or ~> 𝝺pq.ppq

// OR is also known as disjunction, or M* (see the beta reduction below)
// if p is T, short-circuit; we only need 1 T for OR, so p self-selects.
// if p is F, defer to q; q determines whether the expression is T or F
or(T)(T) == T
or(T)(F) == T
or(F)(T) == T
or(F)(F) == F

// let's do a beta reduction substituting x and y for p and q:

//    (𝝺pq.ppq)xy
//    (𝝺pq.ppq)xy = xxy
//             xy = xxy
//              x = xx
//             Mf = ff

// This is known as the Mockingbird-Once-Removed, or M*, because we have Mxy = Mxxy instead of just Mx = Mxx

M(T)(T) == T
M(T)(F) == F
M(F)(F) == T
M(F)(F) == F

// boolean equality?
beq = p => q => p(q)(not(q))
// - : beq ~> 𝝺pq.p(qTF)(qFT), or:
// - : beq ~> 𝝺pq.pq(NOT q)

beq(T)(T) == T
beq(F)(T) == F
beq(T)(F) == F
beq(F)(F) == T
